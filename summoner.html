<p>These are the things that you want as a Summoner. You don't need to get all of them, but you should try to get a good deal. Even if you can get everything, if the Devil is ripping you off, it won't end well for you.</p>
<p>Of course, the Devil won't give you what you want out of the kindness of his heart. You have to give them something in return. Here's what you can offer:<br><ol><li>Your soul<li>Your life<li>Your eternal servitude<li>Your firstborn child</ol></p>
